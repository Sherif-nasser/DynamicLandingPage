# nav-bar 
    header of nav bar is created dynamically using js and it's designed to allow the user to smoothly jump to the wanted section without manually scroll.

# sections
    Sections are designed using basic html and CSS to clearly show all the details of the scrolling process.
    Over each section there is a <datalist> tag where the user can freindly add the desired nav-bar item that indicates the section.Therefore, it can be used easily by anyone even     if they're not into coding.
